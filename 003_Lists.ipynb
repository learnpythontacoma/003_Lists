    "A List is a collection of items that are assigned to a variable in Python. Lists are:\n",
    "1. denoted by square brackets within code \"[ ]\"\n",
    "1. can contain any type of information (e.g., integers, strings, floats, and even other lists)\n",
    "1. can be of any length, from nothing (yes, lists can be empty as we will see) to several thousand entries\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next block of code, you will see a variable called `a`. It is a list (as we can tell by the square brackets around the values) that contains strings, integers, and floats. You will also notice that around each string we are using either single quotation marks ' or double quotation marks \" to tell python these are strings. We have mixed these quotation marks in this example just to show that it can be done and that python accepts either form. (For good coding, we want to generally default to single quotation marks ' as much as possible.)"
